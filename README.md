# School_District_Analysis.
# Overview of the school district analysis:
* The purpose of this challenge was to replace the suspicious 9th grade data for Thomas High School while keeping the results of the module exercise intact. Once corrected, the analysis was rerun to view how a variety of metrics were potentially altered to highschool's math and reading test scores.
# Results
* Given that only a small fraction of the data was altered (Math & Reading scores for a single grade at Thomas High School) much of the data between the module exercise and the challenge remained the same. Below are screen shots of the two results:

# Summary
* Given that all things were kept equal except reading and math scores for 9th graders in Thomas High School, the four changes we can observe took place in the following fields:
1. Average math scores decreased for Thomas High School 
2. Average reading scores decreased for Thomas High School
3. % of students passing math decreased for Thomas High School
4. % of students passing reading decreased for Thomas High School 
* While there were decreases in the above fields, the changes we negligible but they ultimately brought down the overall passing rate of Thomas High School
